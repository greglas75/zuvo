# Environment Compatibility

> How Zuvo skills adapt to different execution environments.

## Execution Models

| Capability | Claude Code | Other (Codex, Cursor, Antigravity) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Sub-agent dispatch | `Agent` tool — parallel, model-routed | Sequential execution (read agent .md, execute yourself) |
| Concurrency | Unrestricted background tasks | Limited or sequential |
| User interaction | Native interactive prompts | Use safest default, annotate `[AUTO-DECISION]` |

## Agent Dispatch

### Claude Code (primary)

Dispatch sub-agents with the Agent tool:

```
Agent(
  description: "Analyze code structure for blast radius",
  model: "sonnet",
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  prompt: [agent instructions here]
)
```

- `subagent_type: "Explore"` — read-only analysis (agent cannot modify files)
- Multiple agents can run in parallel when their work is independent

<!-- PLATFORM:CODEX -->
### Codex

Agents are defined as TOML configs in `~/.codex/agents/`. Skills reference agents by name. Codex resolves and spawns them natively.

```toml
name = "blast-radius-mapper"
model = "gpt-5.4"
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
developer_instructions = """
Read your instructions at ~/.codex/skills/build/agents/blast-radius.md
NEVER modify files — analyze and report only.
"""
```
<!-- /PLATFORM:CODEX -->

<!-- PLATFORM:CURSOR -->
### Cursor

No agent spawning capability. When a skill references an agent:
1. Read the agent's instruction file (e.g., `agents/blast-radius.md`)
2. Perform that analysis yourself in the current context
3. Maintain identical output format and quality standards
<!-- /PLATFORM:CURSOR -->

<!-- PLATFORM:ANTIGRAVITY -->
### Antigravity

Same as Cursor — no agent spawning. Execute sequentially. Models mapped to Gemini tiers: sonnet → gemini-3.1-pro-low, opus → gemini-3.1-pro-high.
<!-- /PLATFORM:ANTIGRAVITY -->

## Progress Tracking

Use structured progress when available, inline text when not:

```
# If TaskCreate is available (Claude Code):
TaskCreate with full phase list, update status as you go

# Otherwise:
STEP: Phase 1 — Code Exploration [START]
... work ...
STEP: Phase 1 — Code Exploration [DONE]
```

## User Interaction

| Gate | Interactive (Claude Code) | Non-interactive (Codex App, Cursor) |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Plan/spec approval | Ask user | Proceed, annotate `[AUTO-APPROVED]` |
| Commit | Ask user | Commit, NEVER push |
| Clarifying question | Ask user | Best-judgment `[AUTO-DECISION]` |

**Hard rule:** Never push to a remote repository without explicit user confirmation, regardless of environment.

## Reviewer Model Routing

Some reviewer workflows need a reviewer that is as strong as possible while still being different from the writer.

Use these abstract reviewer lanes in source artifacts:

- `review-primary` -- strongest preferred reviewer for the current platform
- `review-alt` -- strongest alternate reviewer when `review-primary` would match the writer

Runtime-only fallback lane:

- `same-model-fallback` -- degraded runtime lane used only when a different reviewer cannot be honored

Resolve the concrete reviewer model at runtime with `scripts/reviewer-model-route.sh`.
Do not duplicate the mapping inline in skills or build scripts.

Routing contract:

- detect the writer model from environment
- classify the writer as `small`, `strong_primary`, `strong_alt`, or `unknown`
- emit `review-primary` or `review-alt` when the platform can honor a different reviewer
- emit `same-model-fallback` with an explicit degraded status when the environment cannot honor a different reviewer model
- if the writer classification is `unknown`, emit `routing_status=unknown-writer-model` and do not claim a valid cross-model route
- routing metadata is an orchestration signal, not a security boundary; callers that do not trust their runtime environment must degrade to `unknown-writer-model`

Machine contract for `scripts/reviewer-model-route.sh`:

- runtime routing uses environment detection only
- explicit override flags are allowed only for tests and smoke validation, and only when `ZUVO_ALLOW_REVIEWER_ROUTE_OVERRIDE=1`
- stdout must emit one `KEY=VALUE` line per field in this exact order:
  - `platform`
  - `writer_model`
  - `writer_lane`
  - `reviewer_lane`
  - `reviewer_model`
  - `routing_status`
- stdout must contain only those six keys; diagnostics go to stderr
- callers must parse the keys, not positional prose
- callers must not use `eval`; parse line-by-line, for example with `while IFS='=' read -r key value`
- `routing_status=ok` is valid only when `reviewer_model != writer_model`
- token values must be single-line and must not contain `=`; malformed tokens are sanitized to `unknown`
- callers must reject malformed output: exactly 6 unique keys, no duplicates, no extras, no empty values

Decision table:

| Platform capability | Writer classification | Reviewer lane | Routing status |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| can honor alternate reviewer | `small` | `review-primary` | `ok` |
| can honor alternate reviewer | `strong_alt` | `review-primary` | `ok` |
| can honor alternate reviewer | `strong_primary` | `review-alt` | `ok` |
| cannot honor alternate reviewer | any known lane | `same-model-fallback` | `same-model-fallback` |
| platform unknown | any classification | `same-model-fallback` | `unknown-writer-model` |
| writer classification unknown | `unknown` | `same-model-fallback` | `unknown-writer-model` |

Allowed routing statuses:

- `ok` -- reviewer differs from writer and the platform can honor the route
- `same-model-fallback` -- environment is known but cannot honor a different reviewer
- `unknown-writer-model` -- writer model or platform is unknown, so routing cannot safely pick an alternate
- `routing-failed` -- resolver execution failed, timed out, or emitted malformed output

This routing contract may be reused by isolated blind-audit reviewers and by same-environment adversarial fallback reviewers. If the resolved route is not `ok`, the caller must not pretend the review came from a different model.

Failure mode contract:

- if `scripts/reviewer-model-route.sh` is missing, exits non-zero, or times out, the caller must block or degrade explicitly
- caller-side timeout should fail closed within 5 seconds
- the safe default is to emit all six keys with explicit sentinels:
  - `platform=unknown`
  - `writer_model=unknown`
  - `writer_lane=unknown`
  - `reviewer_lane=same-model-fallback`
  - `reviewer_model=unknown`
  - `routing_status=routing-failed`
- callers must never silently invent their own reviewer mapping after resolver failure
